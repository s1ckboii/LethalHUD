# LethalHUD

Started with maintaining ScanRecolor that quickly got out of hand (oops), I will maintain that for people who want a simpler mod.

Currently this is a ScanRecolor rework with some fixes, custom textures, new configs, and also integrated Hold Scan Button into it.
This mod will be a bit larger as I mess with it in my freetime. Hope you guys will enjoy it!
